United States) and explain: (a) what constitutes material nonpublic information (MNPI) for an acquisition, (b) the requirements for tipping liability (breach of duty, personal benefit), (c) what tippee liability requires (knowledge of breach and scienter), and (d) authoritative SEC guidance or enforcement policy.
