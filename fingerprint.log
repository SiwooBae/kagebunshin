2025-08-15 14:26:11,025 - Processing query: 🧬 CLONE BRIEFING: You are a shadow clone of Humble-Viper! 

PARENT CONTEXT: - Objective: Complete a comprehensive literature review on making LLMs trustworthy, synthesizing key concepts, methods, and evaluations for the implementation catalogue.

- Key actions/results so far: Executed broad searches across Google Scholar and major venues (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, arXiv); extracted top 20 Google Scholar results for “trustworthy large language models calibration robustness alignment RLHF interpretability,” and identified high-value surveys and SoKs to anchor the review. Coordinated parallel scraping and result curation across swarm agents; prepared initial taxonomy ideas (calibration, robustness, alignment, RLHF, interpretability, safety evaluation).

- Current status / blockers / next focus: Need to finalize the top-20 result extraction and summarize each paper’s contribution, method, dataset, evaluation, and limitations; assemble a structured literature map (categories, gaps, conflicting findings). Next: complete result extraction, tokenize a per-paper digest, and draft an initial evidence synthesis outline with concrete evaluation criteria and implementation recommendations.

YOUR MISSION: Open and download top arXiv hits for 'trustworthy LLMs' and extract implementations, datasets, metrics, and code links

Remember: You're working as part of a coordinated swarm. Use the group chat to coordinate with your parent and other agents. Stay focused on your specific task while being aware of the broader mission context.

PARENT CONTEXT: Objective: Conduct a focused literature review for “how to make your LLM trustworthy: an implementation catalogue,” extracting actionable themes and catalogued mitigation strategies.

Key actions/outcomes: Gathered metadata (title, authors, abstract, PDF links) and attempted to pull table of contents from arXiv records; initial search terms centered on trustworthiness, mitigation, evaluation, calibration, robustness, safety, and explainability across arXiv, Google Scholar, NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR.

Current status/blockers/next focus: Metadata extraction initiated but table of contents extraction is incomplete; next, consolidate sources, normalize citations, and extract categorical mappings (mitigation techniques, evaluation metrics, trustworthy-by-design patterns) to build the implementation catalogue.

YOUR MISSION: From Google Scholar: run queries for "trustworthy LLM" "survey" "robustness calibration explainability" and collect top 20 relevant papers with citations and links.

Remember: You're working as part of a coordinated swarm. Use the group chat to coordinate with your parent and other agents. Stay focused on your specific task while being aware of the broader mission context.

Next: finalize and reconcile Education, Certifications, Experience, and Hospital Affiliations, then flag any discrepancies and prepare a final, source-attributed profile with actionable next steps.

YOUR MISSION: Enumerate PubMed publications for 'Kalimullah Quadri' and author variants, extracting PMIDs, titles, journals, years, and affiliation lines to disambiguate authorship; return a deduplicated list.

Remember: You're working as part of a coordinated swarm. Use the group chat to coordinate with your parent and other agents. Stay focused on your specific task while being aware of the broader mission context.

PARENT CONTEXT: - Objective: Compile a comprehensive profile for Dr. Kalimullah Quadri (NPI 1467816546) using the provided provider quality sources.

- Key actions/results so far: Initiated NPI lookup in the NPPES registry to confirm identity and collect core identifiers (name, practice address, taxonomy). Prepared to pull medical education (medical school/ residency), board certifications, experience, publications, patient reviews, hospital affiliations, procedure volume/outcomes, sanctions/malpractice history, Open Payments, and institution quality data (Leapfrog, Joint Commission, CMS data).

- Current status / blockers / next focus: Awaiting NPI Registry results to proceed with source-specific extraction (Doximity/US News for education, ABMS for certifications, Healthgrades for experience, PubMed/Google Scholar for publications, CMS/ProPublica for procedures, and Open Payments for industry ties). Blockers: potential multiple physician matches or name variants; plan to verify with NPPES taxonomy and exact practice location. Next: complete data extraction from each source and synthesize into a concise profile.

YOUR MISSION: Use CMS Care Compare and ProPublica surgeons to find hospital affiliations, procedure volumes, and outcomes for this NPI or provider name

2025-08-15 15:58:22,276 - Processing query: 🧬 CLONE BRIEFING: You are a shadow clone of Witty-Pony! 

PARENT CONTEXT: - Objective: Complete a comprehensive provider profile for Dr. Kalimullah Quadri (NPI 1467816546) focusing on patient reviews, sources, and confidence flags to support overall quality assessment.

- Key actions/results so far: Located Zocdoc profile and captured 57 verified reviews (including expanded content where available) with initial JSON-ready structure; plan to parallelize extraction from Healthgrades, Vitals, Google/Maps, RateMDs, Yelp, WebMD, and hospital pages.

- Current status & next focus: Reviews from additional sites are in progress via parallel tasks; blockers include site pagination/verification nuances and ensuring consistent fields (source, reviewer, date, rating, text, verification). Next: finalize and unify all reviews into a single JSON array with source tagging, deduplicate cross-site duplicates, and flag any missing data or ambiguous ratings for follow-up.

YOUR MISSION: Extract Google Maps / Google Business reviews for Dr. Kalimullah Quadri or New York Cancer & Blood Specialists locations tied to his profile (collect reviewer name, date, rating, text, URL) and return as structured JSON

Remember: You're working as part of a coordinated swarm. Use the group chat to coordinate with your parent and other agents. Stay focused on your specific task while being aware of the broader mission context.

PARENT CONTEXT: - Objective: Compile at least 100 desk toy items from Amazon in JSON format with fields for name, description, and price, using parallelized scraping where possible.
- Actions/results so far: Initiated Amazon search for "desk toys" and started extracting 12 listings per pass, capturing name, short description, and price; currently on a product page (Gravity Defying Kinetic Desk Toy) with price and related items visible.
- Status/next focus: Continue parallel extraction across multiple search/result pages to reach 100+ unique items, ensuring JSON structure integrity; blockers include page variations and anti-scraping measures—need continued page access and deduplication to finalize the 100+ list.

YOUR MISSION: Scrape Amazon search results page 5 for 'desk toys' and collect 12 unique desk toy listings with name, short description, and price
